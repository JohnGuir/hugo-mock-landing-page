In a recent article in migrationpolicy.org the following issues were found with the immigration application process.

The U.S. immigration system, long criticized for its reliance on outdated paper processes and persistent backlogs, has undergone subtle yet significant changes to adapt to the demands of the 21st century, with the COVID-19 pandemic serving as a catalyst. Embracing high-tech solutions and streamlined operations, including increased online application options, remote hearings, extended document validity periods, and interview waivers, has resulted in faster processing of visas, improved access to work permits, and record numbers of cases resolved in immigration courts. Despite ongoing backlog challenges, these steps towards modernization at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the State Department have enhanced the application experience for many immigrants, aiding the rebound of legal immigration post-pandemic. The shift towards technological advancements has brought some transparency to government processes, offering hope for greater efficiency in the future. However, the expiration of temporary policy changes and the potential return to previous operations pose challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations and those with limited digital literacy. Nonetheless, the recent progress signals a potential shift towards a more efficient and accessible immigration system.
